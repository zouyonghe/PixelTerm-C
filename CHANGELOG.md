# Changelog

- v1.1.4: Refactored code and documentation for improved performance and consistency. Restored ImageRenderer's internal caching due to its crucial role in performance, especially when preloading is disabled or during frequent dimension changes. Re-confirmed and removed various unused code including unnecessary <pthread.h> include, browser file filtering/sorting functions, input_is_key_pressed function, and unused mouse event fields. Synchronized docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and include/common.h with current codebase by removing outdated references.
- v1.1.1: Improve file manager scrolling/rendering so the highlighted row stays centered even when the directory has fewer rows than the viewport or when wrapping back to the top.
- v1.1.0: Fix Chinese filename centering in the browser by using UTF-8 display width instead of byte length and improve truncation to respect multibyte characters.
- v1.0.20: Fix preview grid pagination to allow sparse last pages, improve input handling with timeout for escape sequences, fix image file detection using full paths, and add proper error handling for renderer initialization in preloader.
- v1.0.19: Add support for image files without extensions by implementing magic number detection for JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP, and TIFF formats, automatically detecting image files without file extensions by reading file headers while maintaining backward compatibility with extension-based detection.
- v1.0.18: Add wrap-around navigation in file manager (up from top jumps to bottom, down from bottom jumps to top), fix preview zoom jumping issues by using floating-point precision and proper rounding, improve terminal geometry fallback and Konsole handling, clamp terminal cell aspect ratio to sane range, and prefer local chafa at runtime.
- v1.0.16: File manager now sorts entries in AaBb order (uppercase before lowercase within each letter) and skips `$…` system items, matching `ls` ordering while keeping directories grouped ahead of files.
- v1.0.15: Fix image loading for extremely long file paths by streaming via GIO instead of direct file opens, resolving “Filename too long” errors on deep/UTF-8 paths.
- v1.0.14: File manager header now truncates and centers long/UTF-8 paths correctly, and long file/folder names use smarter centering-friendly truncation.
- v1.0.13: Preview grid UX polish (single render on entry, predictable zoom with min 2 columns, better paging/wrap), preloader now truly pauses/disables without burning CPU and fixes cache ownership, and CLI error messages are clearer for help/version/argument cases.
