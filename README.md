# PixelTerm-C - High Performance Terminal Image Viewer

*English | [中文](README_zh.md)*

🖼️ A high-performance terminal image browser written in C, based on the Chafa library.

## Overview

PixelTerm-C is a C implementation of the original PixelTerm application, designed to provide significantly better performance than the Python version while maintaining all the same functionality. By leveraging the Chafa library directly instead of using subprocess calls, we eliminate the overhead of Python interpretation and external process creation.

Release notes: see `CHANGELOG.md`.

## 🌟 Features

- 🖼️ **Multi-format Support** - Supports JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, WebP, TIFF and other mainstream image formats
- 🎬 **Animated GIF Support** - Play animated GIFs directly in the terminal with proper timing and high-quality rendering
- 🎨 **TrueColor Rendering** - Full 24-bit color support with automatic detection and optimization
- 📁 **Smart Browsing** - Automatically detects image files in directories with directory navigation support
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Navigation** - Switch between images with arrow keys, supporting various terminal environments
- 📏 **Adaptive Display** - Automatically adapts to terminal size changes
- 🎨️ **Minimal Interface** - No redundant information, focused on image browsing experience
- ⚡️ **High Performance** - 5-10x faster than Python version with significantly lower memory usage
- 🔄 **Circular Navigation** - Seamless browsing with wrap-around between first and last images
- 🏗️ **Multi-architecture Support** - Native support for both amd64 and aarch64 (ARM64) architectures
- 📦 **Preloading** - Optional image preloading for faster navigation

## Performance Improvements

| Metric | Python Version | C Version | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| Startup Time | ~1-2s | ~0.1-0.3s | Several times faster |
| Image Switching | ~200-500ms | ~50-150ms | 2-5x faster |
| Memory Usage | ~50-100MB | ~15-35MB | 2-3x reduction |
| CPU Usage | High (Python + subprocess) | Medium (pure C) | Noticeable reduction |

## 🚀 Quick Start

```

### Quick Install

```bash
# Install from package manager (recommended)
# Arch Linux: pacman -S pixelterm-c

# Or download binary for your architecture and platform
# Linux AMD64:
wget https://github.com/zouyonghe/PixelTerm-C/releases/latest/download/pixelterm-amd64-linux
chmod +x pixelterm-amd64-linux && sudo mv pixelterm-amd64-linux /usr/local/bin/pixelterm

# Linux ARM64:
wget https://github.com/zouyonghe/PixelTerm-C/releases/latest/download/pixelterm-arm64-linux
chmod +x pixelterm-arm64-linux && sudo mv pixelterm-arm64-linux /usr/local/bin/pixelterm

# macOS AMD64:
wget https://github.com/zouyonghe/PixelTerm-C/releases/latest/download/pixelterm-amd64-macos
chmod +x pixelterm-amd64-macos && sudo mv pixelterm-amd64-macos /usr/local/bin/pixelterm

# macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon):
wget https://github.com/zouyonghe/PixelTerm-C/releases/latest/download/pixelterm-arm64-macos
chmod +x pixelterm-arm64-macos && sudo mv pixelterm-arm64-macos /usr/local/bin/pixelterm

# Note for macOS users: If the binary fails to start due to security restrictions, run:
# xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine pixelterm-arm64-macos
```

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zouyonghe/PixelTerm-C.git
cd PixelTerm-C
make

# For cross-compilation to aarch64
make CC=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc ARCH=aarch64
```

### Usage

```bash
# Browse images in directory (launches directly into preview grid if images exist)
./pixelterm /path/to/images

# View single image (opens image viewer)
./pixelterm /path/to/image.jpg

# Run in current directory
./pixelterm

# Show version
./pixelterm --version

# Show help
./pixelterm --help

# Disable preloading
./pixelterm --no-preload /path/to/images
```

## 🎮 Controls



### Global Controls

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| ESC | Exit application |
| Ctrl+C | Force exit |

### Image View (Single Image Mode)

This is the default mode when viewing a single image.

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| ←/→ | Previous/Next image |
| h/l | Vim-style navigation (previous/next image) |
| Enter | Toggle into Grid Preview mode |
| TAB | Toggle into File Manager mode; returns to this view on subsequent TAB |
| i | Toggle image information display |
| r | Delete current image |

### Grid Preview (Thumbnail Mode)

This mode displays multiple image thumbnails in a grid.

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| ←/→ | Move selection left/right |
| ↑/↓ | Move selection up/down |
| h/j/k/l | Vim-style navigation (left/down/up/right) |
| PgUp/PgDn | Page up/down through the grid |
| Enter | Open selected image in Image View |
| +/- | Increase/decrease thumbnail size |
| TAB | Toggle into File Manager mode; returns to this view on subsequent TAB |

### File Manager Mode

This mode allows browsing through directories and files. Note that Vim-style navigation (h/j/k/l) is not supported here, as letter keys are reserved for quickly jumping to file entries.

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| ←/→ | Go to parent directory / Open selected directory/file |
| ↑/↓ | Navigate entries up/down |
| Enter | Open selected directory or file |
| TAB | Return to the previous image view or grid preview; no effect if FM was entered directly |
| Any Letter (a-z/A-Z) | Jump to next entry starting with that letter |
